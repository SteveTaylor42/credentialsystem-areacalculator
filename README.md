# Credential System (with Area Calculator)

A credential storage and checking system (with user permissions) which contains a room area calculator.
User menu options vary depending on current user credentials, and program loops until user specifies to exit.

Created for a task set during Python training, where I was given 3 days to create an area calculator system that could programmatically change the contents of a file. I used to opportunity to test a user login system that could read to, and write from, txt files in a different directory.
Credential Checker and Data Manager modules perform error handling and ensure all input and integral references, including directories, variable types, and credential formats, are valid.
